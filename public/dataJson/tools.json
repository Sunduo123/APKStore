Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.\n\nIndividual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.\n\nVPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.\n\nMobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network."

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.\n\nIndividual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.\n\nVPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.\n\nMobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network."

            "description": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n\nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service: Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings. Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

Turn your smartphone into a remote controller for the TV. User-friendly interface. It’s basically the old remote but more compact. Have more functions in it. It is personalized to your own taste.\n\nAlways near you, and you always know where to find it.

To do this, you’ll need to enable \"Hey Google\" detection. You can also tap either the Voice Access notification or a blue Voice Access button and start talking.\n\nTo pause Voice Access temporarily, just say \"stop listening\". To disable Voice Access completely, go to Settings > Accessibility > Voice Access and turn off the switch.\n\nFor additional support, see Voice Access help.\n\nThis app uses the AccessibilityService API to help users with motor impairments. It uses the API to collect information about the controls on the screen and activate them based on the user’s spoken instructions."

With one free download, you get an everyday private Internet browser that offers seamless protection while you search and browse, and access to tracking protection for emails you receive and apps you use. Many of these protections are not offered in most popular web browsers by default.\n \nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\nSearch Privately by Default – DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n \nBlock Tracking Cookies While Browsing – Prevent most 3rd-party Internet cookies from tracking you as you browse online.\n \nEscape Website Trackers Before They Load – Automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using any personal data from these trackers. Stay secure with our cutting-edge tracker-blocking technology – 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection, which goes above and beyond what you get in most popular web browsers by default.\n \nAutomatically Enforce Encryption – Force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider.\n \nBlock Email Trackers (Beta) – Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses (@duck.com) contain trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n \nProtect Your Privacy in Other Apps – Block most hidden app trackers in other apps day or night, and prevent third-party companies from invading your privacy with App Tracking Protection. This feature uses a VPN connection, but is not a VPN. It works locally on your device and does not collect personal data.\n \nEscape Fingerprinting – Help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your web browser and device settings.\n \nBlock Tracking Cookies – Prevent most third-party cookies from tracking you as you browse online from website to website.\n \nWe feature many protections not available on most Internet browsers (even incognito browsers), including protection from link tracking, Google AMP tracking, and more.\n \nEVERYDAY PRIVACY CONTROLS\nTap Fire Button, Burn Data – Clear your tabs and browsing data fast with our Fire Button.\n \nSignal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) – Built in to our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n \nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks."

            "description": "ApowerMirror is a wireless screen mirroring app that can be used to cast Android phone to PC, Mac, Smart TV (TV box) with AUDIO. It allows you to mirror&control one Android device to another Android device freely, and you can remotely control Android from PC or Mac with your mouse and keyboard. Besides, streaming the mirrored screen to applications like OBS Studio or Zoom becomes easier.\n\nKey Features:\n\n🏆Mirror Android to PC and Vice Versa\n\nApowerMirror allows you to cast Android to PC with audio. No need for an AUX cable, it can truly achieve audio and video synchronization while screen mirroring. Using this, you can freely stream videos, display apps, share meeting contents, or play Android games from PC or Mac in full-screen mode. Besides, you can display your PC screen on your phone and control it from your phone. With that, you can access all files on your computer and even use PC programs on your phone with no hassle.\n\n\n🏆Mirror&Control Phone from Phone\n\nApowerMirror is also a good screen mirroring app to mirror phone to phone or tablet. You can also share your screen with another phone using ApowerMirror to watch videos and movies with your friends and share your files with your audience easily.\n\n\n🏆Accessibility APl\n\nApowerMirror requires \"Accessibility\" permission to help you use the reverse control feature. This feature allows you to better help your family and friends debug their phones, and in corporate meetings, you can control your phone for demonstrations efficiently. Denying the accessibility permission will prevent you from using the reverse control-related functions, and will not affect the use of other features.\n\n\n🏆Cast Phone to TV\n\nThis screencasting app also does well in screen mirroring Android to TV. Whether you want to stream movies, watch videos, share photos or play games right on the big screen, it just takes a few taps to mirror your phone's display to your TV. It supports TVs like Sony TV, LG TV, Philips TV, Sharp TV, Hisense TV, Xiaomi MI TV, and other TVs running Android OS.\n\n\n🏆AirCast - Screen Mirror Between Different Networks\n\nThis advanced feature allows screen mirroring between devices that cannot be connected to the same network. If you use this feature, even if you are located in different places and on different network connections, you can share the screen with each other. This can be used to mirror phone to phone, cast phone to PC, and stream PC to phone.\n\n\n🏆Control Android from PC/Mac\n\nWhen screen mirroring Android to PC/Mac, you can take full control of the screen with your mouse and keyboard. Therefore, you are able to share PPT to your colleagues, enjoy movies on a bigger screen, or play phone games such as Mobile Legends, PUBG Mobile, Fortnite, Minecraft, and other games on the computer.\n\n\n🏆Multi-screens on One Computer\n\nApowerMirror supports mirroring 4 devices simultaneously without delay, which greatly improves the efficiency of your daily life. With this tool, you can enjoy different screens at the same time and stop switching from one app to another.\n\n\nSuitable for Various Screen Mirroring Occasions:\n\n*Personal use☑️\n\n*Business meeting☑️\n\n*Online class /Education☑️\n\n*Live streaming for mobile games☑️\n\n*Movies/Sports video mirroring☑️\n\n*Presentation☑️\n\n*Work from home☑️\n\n……\n\n👇Supported Devices:\n\n1.

(details explained in settings)\n\nNever should your phone or tablet become slower and battery hungrier after lots of apps installed. With Greenify, your device can run almost as smoothly and lastingly as it did the first day you had it!\n\nGreenify help you identify and put the misbehaving apps into hibernation when you are not actively using them, to stop them from lagging your device or leeching the battery, in a unique way! They can do nothing without explicit launch by you or other apps, while still preserving full functionality when running in foreground.\n\nGreenify NEVER EVER collects your personal data despite the capability of accessibility service, it just takes advantage of it to automate the hibernation procedure.\n\nIMPORTANT: Greenifying an app implies that you are aware that all the background functionality (service, periodic task, event receiver, alarm, widget update, push message) of this app will become out of service during the hibernation except when you are using this app.\n\nNEVER greenify alarm clock apps, instant messaging apps unless you don't rely on them. Please do verify the impact of greenified apps on which you heavily rely.\n\nNote: Greenify does need background running services for auto-hibernation to work. It is designed and implemented in extremely lightweight and nearly zero CPU and battery consumption."

Our app helps you find potential hidden devices nearby.\n\nThis app uses an algorithm to detect hidden devices using magnetometer readings. When the magnetic field value is higher than usual, the app alerts user to search for potential hidden electronic devices in the surroundings.\n\nFeatures of Detectify - Detect Hidden Devices:\n- Simple to use\n- Helps you to find hidden devices\n- Graphical representation of Magnetic field values\n- Tips for Manual detection of hidden devices\n\nUsage:\nOpen the feature named Detect by using magnetometer in the app, then move your phone in your surroundings. The app will show a message that potential electronic device nearby, if this happens then check the area manually for any spy bugs. Mostly holes or gaps in the corners, such as bedside lamps, drawer locks and stuffed toys can be used to hide electronic devices. This feature may also be used as a bug detector scanner to scan the surroundings for potential electronic bugs.\n\nWorking:\nElectronic devices have magnetic field which our app measures by using magnetometer sensor to give you an idea about the presence of potential electronic devices in your surroundings. Rather than using manual listening device detector you can make use of this app to find potential spy devices.\n\nNote:\nThe magnetic field value depends on quality of magnetometer sensor and its position. Do not rely solely on its readings rather check the area manually to detect hidden cameras and microphones. Your phone must have a magnetometer sensor to use the app.\n\nDo write to us for any suggestions or complaints."

            "description": "Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online. We know that every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link’s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.\n\n\nWith Family Link, you can:\n\nEstablish Digital Ground Rules\n• Set screen time limits — Family Link lets you set downtime for your child’s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.\n• Guide them to age-appropriate content — Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.\n\nManage and secure your child’s account\n• Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device.\n• Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.\n\nStay connected on the go\n• See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.\n• Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location. You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.\n\n\nImportant Information\n\n• Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/\n• While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\n• You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.\n• To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.\n• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.\n• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family."
