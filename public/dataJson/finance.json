No interest, no annual fees, no credit check to apply.\n\nPAY ANYONE WITH NO TRANSFER FEES\nSend money to friends, family, or roommates as fast as a text – with no transfer fees.\n–––––\nBanking services provided by The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank, N.A., Members FDIC.

The Chime Visa® Credit Builder Card is issued by Stride Bank pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. Debit card and Credit card may be used everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted.\n\n*Chime SpotMe is an optional, no fee service that requires a single deposit of $200 or more in qualifying direct deposits to the Chime Checking Account each month. All qualifying members will be allowed to overdraw their account up to $20 on debit card purchases and cash withdrawals initially, but may be later eligible for a higher limit of up to $200 or more based on member's Chime Account history, direct deposit frequency and amount, spending activity and other risk-based factors. Your limit will be displayed to you within the Chime mobile app. You will receive notice of any changes to your limit. Your limit may change at any time, at Chime's discretion. Although there are no overdraft fees, there may be out-of-network or third party fees associated with ATM transactions. SpotMe won't cover non-debit card transactions, including ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, or Chime Checkbook transactions. See Terms and Conditions.\n\n‡Out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.\n\n^Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer. We generally make these funds available on the day the payment file is received, which may be up to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date.\n\n¹To be eligible to apply for Credit Builder, you need to have received a qualifying direct deposit of $200 or more to your Checking Account within 365 days of your Credit Builder application. See http://chime.com/applycb for details on qualifying direct deposit.\n\n²Based on a representative study conducted by Experian®, members who made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2020 and October 2020 observed an average FICO® Score 8 increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score.\n\nChime received the highest 2021 Net Promoter Score among competitors in the industry according to Qualtrics®."

You can see personal loan offers on the Credit Karma personal loan marketplace from third party advertisers from which Credit Karma receives compensation. Credit Karma members are shown offers with Outstanding Approval Odds** when available to them. Offers with Outstanding Approval Odds have rates that range from 5.4% APR to 35.99% APR with terms from 12 months to 7 years. Rates are subject to change without notice and are controlled by our third party advertisers, not Credit Karma. Depending on the particular lender, other fees may apply, such as origination fees or late payment fees. See the particular lender’s terms and conditions for additional details. All loan offers on Credit Karma require your application and approval by the lender. You may not qualify for a personal loan at all or you may not qualify for the lowest rates or the highest offer amounts.\n\nPERSONAL LOAN REPAYMENT EXAMPLE. The following example assumes a $15,000 personal loan with a four year (48 month) term. For APRs ranging from 5.4% to 35.99%, monthly payments would range from $349 to $594. Assuming all of the 48 payments are made on-time, the total amount paid would range from $16,712 to $28,492."
