During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.\n\nNote: once you restore chat backup from WhatsApp Messenger to WhatsApp Business, you will no longer be able to restore it back to WhatsApp Messenger. If you would like to go back, we recommend that you copy the WhatsApp Messenger backup on your phone to your computer before you start using WhatsApp Business.\n---------------------------------------------------------"

            "description": "Get rid of the unsolicited calls once forever. Safely and absolutely free.\n\nTelemarketers, phone scams or „just“ unsolicited surveys? The Should I Answer app can get you rid of all such calls.\n\nHow does the app work?\n\nWhenever some unknown number calls the app checks it in its permanently updated database - immediately, without internet connection. If it finds out that other users reported the respective number as nuisance, it warns you against it. Or if you want it so, it can block it directly, the caller will not be able to reach you.\n\nIt is just the database used by the Should I Answer app which is an absolute unique part. It is composed directly by the users of the app: after each unknown call the users can rate it anonymously either as safe or spam. After approval given by our admins the report is then visible in the database where all users can benefit from.\n\nWhat the app can do?\n\n• It can protect you effectively against the unsolicited calls. You can set the level of protection exactly according to your needs: from simple alert of unsolicited call to direct blocking.\n\n• It can block even hidden, foreign or premium rate numbers. Also you can write your own lists of blocked or allowed numbers.\n\n• The app can be used as fully functional dialer app: you will find all your Contacts, favourite Contacts and complete call history in it.\n\n• The app can protect you even offline. If you need to update the local database it waits for your wi-fi connection.\n\n• It’s simple, even your grandma can use it :-)\n\n\nHow does the app deal with your personal data?\n\nEverything is happening directly in your phone, and in your phone only - your data is never by passed to some 3rd party. The app can’t „see“ even your own phone number, all reports are fully anonymous, the app doesn’t send even your Contacts anywhere."

            "description": "See what your car is doing in realtime, get OBD fault codes, car performance, sensor data and more!\n\nTorque is a vehicle / car performance / diagnostics tool and scanner that uses an OBD II Bluetooth adapter to connect to your OBD2 engine management / ECU\n\nLayout your own dashboard with the widgets / gauges you want!\n\nIt can use the GPS to provide tracker logs with OBD engine logging so you can see what you were doing at any point in time\n\nIt can also show and reset a DTC / CEL / fault code like a scantool.

The adapter is small and plugs into the diagnostics socket on the car which gives your phone access. You can find a list of adapters on: http://torque-bhp.com/wiki/Bluetooth_Adapters (Garmin EcoRoute HD adapters not supported)\n\nIf you buy one of the cheap china OBD2 ELM327 bluetooth adapters from ebay / amazon, then make sure you have a good returns policy with the seller\n\nSome of the best reliable OBD2 / OBD adapters are the Scantool.net adapter, the OBDKey, and PLX Devices, OBDLink, Bluetooth, ELM327 and other adapters are supported - search on google for them\n\nMore features added every release - there are forums at http://torque-bhp.com/forums/ - if you want something added then let me know and I'll try to add it if it is possible! Vehicle ECUs vary in the amount of sensors supported\n\n*PLEASE NOTE* Any reports of hanging or reboots after quitting the app is due to a bug in HTC devices and Galaxy Tab,this can be triggered by using the Pandora/Vlingo/Other BT apps. Disabling Pandoras new bluetooth settings fixes the problem, but HTC/Samsung need to release a fix.Please contact their support and request a fix,Thanks!"

With this app, you can retrieve text messages and media files that have been deleted, giving you the ability to access important information or sentimental content that you thought was lost forever.</p><h3>Features of WAMR</h3><p>WAMR works by utilizing your device's notifications to recover text messages. This means that even if a chat is on silent mode or you are currently viewing a message before it gets deleted, WAMR can still retrieve it and display it as a notification. Additionally, the app attempts to save any media attachments in messages. If a sender deletes a media file, WAMR will send you a notification and save the media if possible. The supported media types include pictures, videos, animated gifs, audio, voice notes, documents, and stickers.</p><p>It's important to note that messages are encrypted on your device, ensuring that WAMR cannot directly access them. However, this also means that it is impossible to recover notifications or messages that were received before installing the app. To maximize the recovery chances, it is recommended to quickly download WAMR and ensure that messages and media are not blocked by your phone's battery optimization services. Adjusting settings in your messaging app's data and storage usage might also be necessary to automatically download media when not using a WiFi connection.</p><h3>FAQ</h3><p>1) Can WAMR recover all deleted messages?</p><p>WAMR utilizes notifications to recover messages, so it can only retrieve messages that are saved as notifications. If a message is not displayed as a notification, WAMR will not be able to recover it.</p><p>2) Are there any limitations to using WAMR?</p><p>To ensure successful recovery, WAMR relies on the Android OS and individual messaging apps. These apps may have limitations or restrictions that could affect WAMR's functionality. Additionally, messages and media that are not saved as notifications cannot be recovered.</p><p>3) How does WAMR handle deleted media files?</p><p>WAMR attempts to save any media attachments in messages. If a sender deletes a media file, WAMR will send you a notification and save the media if possible. However, there may be cases where the media cannot be saved due to various factors.</p><h3>Editor's Note</h3><p>WAMR is a highly useful app for anyone who has accidentally deleted important messages or media files. Its ability to recover deleted messages from notifications provides a convenient workaround, although there are limitations based on the Android OS and messaging app restrictions. With WAMR, you have a comprehensive solution to recover text messages and various forms of media, giving you peace of mind knowing that you can retrieve valuable information and cherished memories.</p>"
