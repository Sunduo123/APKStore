You’ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support and debate groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types. Start exploring and find like-minded people!\nReddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment anonymously) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:\n■ r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions on the largest Q&A forum\n■ r/funny, which is full of humorous content\n■ r/science, for scientific discussions and news\n■ r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure\n\nOn Reddit you’ll find:\n■ Thousands of community groups, interesting people and bloggers\nBreaking news, leaked gossip, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions, debates and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.\n■ Loads of laughs\nFind memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.\n■ AMAs, or \"Ask Me Anything\" - unfiltered Q&A sessions\nCelebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.\n■ The best discussions on any topic\nReddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, leaked news, gossip or financial advice.\n■ Get answers to anonymous questions\nAsk communities anything you want.

Don’t be afraid to release your voice and debate people from all over the world!\n\nVoting and Karma:\nInstead of likes and hearts, Reddit’s social network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.\nWhile karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.\nJoin the largest social media platform and discover everything that piques your interest!\n\nReddit Premium:\nPurchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Google Play account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device’s Account Settings.

            "description": "Pingo is a companion app to the Findmykids location tracker, our app for parents. It was developed for location tracking of children. Please only install this location tracker app on a device used by a child or teenager.\nWe recommend you start by downloading the Findmykids parent tracker app on your phone. After that, install the Pingo GPS location tracker on your child's device and enter the code from the Findmykids app you received when you signed up.\nDone! Now you can use kids GPS tracker!\n\nOUR KEY FEATURES:\n\nKids GPS tracker – see your child's location on the map and the history of the day's activity - an online location diary. Make sure that your child does not go to dangerous places with our locator. You can also get your child a kid smart watch and connect it to the Pingo app.\nSound around – listen to what's going on around your child with the help of our location tracker to make sure they're okay. This feature works only if the child tracker is installed and set up on their phone.\nLoud signal – send a loud signal to your child's phone where the child tracker is installed if they have left it in their backpack or on silent mode and can't hear the call. If they lose kid smart watch, you can also find them with the help of our GPS watch tracking app.\nScreen time manager – find out what apps they used at school, and whether they played in class instead of learning. Pingo kids GPS tracker can be used instead of any parental control apps.\nNotifications – make sure your child is on time for school: get notifications when they get to school, back home, and other places you've created. Our parent tracker app will send you a notification.\nBattery control – remind your child to charge the phone on time: you will be notified if the battery is about to run out. The feature also works with kid smart watch and GPS watch tracking app\nFamily chat – chat with your child in the chat room with fun stickers and send voice messages in the child tracker app\n\nYou can see your child's online location for free once the devices are connected. Other features in the free version (like parental control app for child phone) are available with restrictions. To use all the features of the app, you should buy a subscription.\n\nIf your child doesn't have a phone, you can buy a kid smart watch and connect them to our GPS watch tracking app.\n\nIn case of technical problems with our parent tracker app, you can always contactFindmykids 24-hour support via support chat in the app or by e-mail"

Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world.\n\nA few things you can do on Threads…\n\n■ Access your Instagram followers\nYour Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.\n\n■ Share your point of view\nSpin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.\n\n■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators\nJump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.\n\n■ Control the conversation\nCustomize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically.\n\n■ Find ideas and inspiration\nFrom TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.\n\n■ Never miss a moment\nStay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.\n\n■ Open social networking – coming soon\nIn the future, there will be ways to discover more content and reach wider audiences: we are planning features that allow you to search for, follow and interact with users on open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet."

            "description": "The #1 free-speech social media platform is now available as a native Android app!\n\nIn the year 2021, the media pendulum has swung dangerously far to the left. Silicon Valley, the mainstream media, and Big Tech have begun to forcibly silence voices that do not align with their woke ideology. Big Tech platforms demonetize, throttle, and cancel those who stray from the mainstream narrative. They are not just censoring content – they are determining what can and cannot be said. By controlling how information is shared, they control the narrative. They control the future. They control you.\n\nTo counter this dangerous exercise of Big Tech monopoly power, Truth Social intends to even the playing field by providing people with an open media platform where they can share and create content without fear of reputational ruin.\n\nNo political discrimination.\nCanceling cancel culture.\nStanding up to Big Tech.\n\nJoin us.\n\nKey Features\n\nProfile - Express your unique personality by setting up a profile, avatar, and background. Begin to track your personal connections through follower and following counts as well as history for your posts and likes.\n\nTruth Feed - Get the scoop on the latest thoughts and activities from the people, organizations, and news outlets that interest you. The Truth Feed contains posts from all those you follow brought to life with the help of thumbnail photos, links, and more.\n\nCompose Truths - Let your voice be heard. Sign up, join the conversation, and share your unique opinion by posting a Truth, Re-Truth, photo, news story, poll or video link to communicate with your friends, customers, and the world. Stay informed about breaking news while staying directly connected with the people who influence you – don't be shocked if they take your Truth viral!\n\nSearch - Truth Social really starts to become interesting as you connect with others. Search for a voice that you find interesting and easily follow them right from the search list or view their profile first before deciding.\n\nDirect Messages - Take your conversations private by direct messaging your followers for 1-on-1 chats! Set messages to auto-delete after 7, 14, 30, or 90 days on a per-chat basis. Silence push notifications for all chats or on a per-chat basis. You can also turn off the ability for those you follow to DM you (in your Preferences) as well as block users, copy, delete and report messages.\n\nPolls – Create polls to get feedback on a question you may have.\n\nNotifications - Stay engaged as you build a following. See who's following you and who's interacting with your Truths."

Weâre building your new front door to the internet.Diem is a search-engine-meets-social-network designed first for girls, women, and LGBTQIA+ folks. You can search the internet with Diem AI and find answers to anything life throws at you. âHow do I get over a friend breakup? Whatâs the best way to negotiate salary? My boyfriend follows models on Instagramâis that a red flag?â Diem is here to help.Our platform is also full of novel, collective knowledge from people all over the world. You can socialize your search to start conversations, discover a network of communities, connect over shared experiences and browse trending topics.Joining Diem means showing up with no judgment and immersing yourself in the candid, funny, authentic, important, supportive, outrageous, honest, and wholesome questions of other Diemers, which span everything from birth control to friendship, sexuality to pop culture, parenting to relationships, money to reproductive health, career to books, and so much more. Diem feels more like searching for answers in the girlsâ bathroom than spiraling alone on the internet.Hereâs what you can find in the app today:Diem AI-powered searchAsk Diem AI, our AI-powered search tool, your questions! Our search engine is designed to be less bias than other models. You can think of Diem AI as your most knowledgeable Virgo âbig sisterâ who lives in your back pocket. Diem AI draws from across the internet and the collective wisdom of Diemers to generate you a speedy answer. When you ask Diem AI youâll receive a short summary answer, community sources (previous, related conversations in Diem), community spaces, web pages, Reddit threads and TikTok videos. You can dive in to these search results OR you can post your search to the community feed to get real-time feedback from people whoâve been there.Diem AI LensesYou can now ask questions of leading experts and your fave creators in Diem. Ask their Lens anything and your search result will feature their opinions & content from across the internet.Discover thousands of authentic conversationsFrom awkward sex questions to wholesome big sisterly advice or navigating lifeâs highs and lows, Diem is full of the collective knowledge of girls, women, and LGBTQIA+ folks in over 100 countries.Thereâs no judgment here and youâll feel that very quickly.Post anonymously or under a pseudonymWe think of the anonymous feature as a confidence booster. Sometimes posting âtabooâ questions or personal stories publicly can be nerve-wracking, so this feature is designed to make you feel more comfortable while getting the advice you need.Community SpacesCommunity Spaces are micro communities that are also discoverable when related questions are searched via Diem AI. A few currently live: Am I wrong?, Big Sis Advice (BSA) and Is this Normalâ¦? (ITN) Weâre still early in building out Spaces and you can request additional Spaces or host your own.Creating PostsIf you have a longer story, recommendation or advice to offer you can click the + button on your Discover feed and type out all your stories or wisdom. These posts will be discovered via the search engine and in Diemerâs discovery feeds.Upvoting & BookmarkingSee a post or response you want to save for later or give some love to, click to bookmark, âheartâ or upvote it!Safety & Privacy FirstSafety & moderation are our top priority at Diem. See something, say something! We have distributed moderationâif you report something, we review it, ensuring thereâs no violation of the community culture. We also take your privacy very seriouslyâwhatever you search is your business.Weâre still early in our journey to build Diem into your new âfront doorâ to the internet, if you have any problems or ideas for the app, get support at"
