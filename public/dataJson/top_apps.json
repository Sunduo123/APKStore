            "description": "RadarScope is a specialized display utility for weather enthusiasts and meteorologists that allows you view NEXRAD Level 3 and Super-Resolution radar data along with Tornado, Severe Thunderstorm, Flash Flood and Special Marine Warnings, and predicted storm tracks issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada and Australian Bureau of Meteorology radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail.\n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, and special marine warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values.\n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy).\n\nYou can display data from NOAA's public access web site, our optional WDT feed (the default), or your AllisonHouse subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time lightning data in the U.S. and Canada that animates along with the radar loop and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including SPC outlooks, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will be charged to your Google Play account. Subscriptions renew automatically, and you're charged at the beginning of each subscription period. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your Google Play app after the purchase.\n\nRadarScope for Android includes RadarScope for Wear OS devices. The Wear app does not support Pro Tier One or Tier Two features.\n\nPlease visit our web site for more information."

It‚Äôs the dating app where kindness is sexy, and women come first‚Äîalways.\n\n\nBumble is a free dating app dedicated to helping singles find fun, meaningful, and kind connections. It‚Äôs the dating app where kindness is sexy, and where women come first, always. We champion respect and equality, and we don't just welcome, but we celebrate every orientation. So whether you're straight, gay, lesbian, trans, here to find love, here to find fun, here to find friends, or simply dating for the plot‚Äìcreating new connections has never been easier.\n\n\nOur community is filled with millions of people across the globe who are ready to chat and meet new people, build genuine and meaningful connections, and maybe find that artsy, museum-loving, Scorpio they've been looking for.\n\n\nDATE, MEET NEW FRIENDS, AND NETWORK\n\nOur matchmaking technology is constantly evolving to create a fun, kind, and most importantly safe experience for you across all of our apps, including:\n\n\nBumble Date: Where women make the first move.

Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new exciting career opportunities.\n\n\nWOMEN COME FIRST, ALWAYS\n\nWe believe a better world for women means a better world for everyone. So, for the most part, women get to make the first move around here. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond. So, don't let them be the one that got away. Send that message ASAP.\n\n\nDON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT\n\n‚ÄúBumble exists to empower women...‚Äù (Fast Company)\n\n‚ÄúBumble is just an app: but it‚Äôs changing the discussion.‚Äù (Wired)\n\n‚ÄúBumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:‚Äù (UK Sunday Times)\n\n‚ÄúBumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app‚Äù (Texas Standard)\n\n‚ÄúWhat makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ‚Äù (Business Insider)\n\n\n---\n\n\nLike the best things in life, Bumble is free to download and use. But we do also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\n\n\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month, and 6 month subscriptions with varying discounts. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\n* If you don‚Äôt choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free."

Maximum balance and transfer limits apply per account. Credit Builder is not provided by MVB Bank.\n\n** A connected paycheck or one time direct deposit of $750 is required for activation. Credit Builder plan is serviced by Credit Karma Credit Builder and requires a line of credit and savings account provided by Cross River Bank, Member FDIC. Members with a TransUnion credit score of 619 or below who opened a Credit Builder plan and had it reported on their TransUnion report saw an average credit score increase of 21 points in 4 days of activating the plan.\n\n***Approval Odds are not a guarantee of approval. Credit Karma looks at how your credit profile compares to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the offer shown or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender.\n\nSome screen images are simulated.\n\nInsurance services offered through Karma Insurance Services, LLC. CA resident license #0172748.\n\nELIGIBILITY AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS; PERSONAL LOAN INTEREST RATES AND FEES. You can see personal loan offers on the Credit Karma personal loan marketplace from third party advertisers from which Credit Karma receives compensation. Credit Karma members are shown offers with Outstanding Approval Odds** when available to them. Offers with Outstanding Approval Odds have rates that range from 5.4% APR to 35.99% APR with terms from 12 months to 7 years. Rates are subject to change without notice and are controlled by our third party advertisers, not Credit Karma. Depending on the particular lender, other fees may apply, such as origination fees or late payment fees. See the particular lender‚Äôs terms and conditions for additional details. All loan offers on Credit Karma require your application and approval by the lender. You may not qualify for a personal loan at all or you may not qualify for the lowest rates or the highest offer amounts.\n\nPERSONAL LOAN REPAYMENT EXAMPLE. The following example assumes a $15,000 personal loan with a four year (48 month) term. For APRs ranging from 5.4% to 35.99%, monthly payments would range from $349 to $594. Assuming all of the 48 payments are made on-time, the total amount paid would range from $16,712 to $28,492."

The process takes longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection is worth the wait.\n\nUsers can use Tor to access an overlay network of 7,000+ relays, provided free of charge by volunteers worldwide, for the purpose of hiding users' real addresses and avoiding network surveillance and traffic analysis. tor users' Internet activities (including browsing online sites, posts, and forms of communication such as instant messaging) are relatively difficult to track. tor was originally designed to protect users' personal privacy and the freedom to Tor is designed to protect users' personal privacy and the freedom and ability to communicate in secret, unmonitored ways.\n\nTor does not prevent online sites from determining whether a user has accessed the site through Tor. While it protects the user's privacy, it does not disguise the fact that the user is using Tor. Some sites place restrictions on users who use Tor. Tor encrypts data, including the IP address of the next relay, multiple times and commits it through virtual circuits, including randomly selected Tor relays. Each relay decrypts one layer of encrypted data to know the next destination to which the data will be sent, and then sends the remaining encrypted data to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encrypted data and sends the original data to the destination address without revealing or knowing the source IP address."

These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail.\n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, and special marine warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values.\n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy).\n\nYou can display data from NOAA's public access web site, our optional WDT feed (the default), or your AllisonHouse subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time lightning data in the U.S. and Canada that animates along with the radar loop and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including SPC outlooks, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will be charged to your Google Play account. Subscriptions renew automatically, and you're charged at the beginning of each subscription period. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your Google Play app after the purchase.\n\nRadarScope for Android includes RadarScope for Wear OS devices. The Wear app does not support Pro Tier One or Tier Two features.\n\nPlease visit our web site for more information."
